        <p class="lead mb-4">	My name is Makayla Zamora and I am currently employed as a hostess at Anchos Southwest Bar and Grill. I have been working at this location just under a year and informally the head hostess. Moreover, I have started to transition into the next stage: running food, and hope to be a waitress by the end of the year. At this job, I have made invaluable connections with coworkers and really established myself as a reliable employee. I have been commended for my speed, competency, ability to keep calm under pressure, and even was assigned to train new hostesses. I am often scheduled to open because of my consistency and my coworkers come to me to ask questions.
<br><br>

        	A lot of these leadership skills come from the numerous organizations I was a part of in high school that equipped me with a multitude of skills. The primary institution I was enrolled in was DECA, a business and entrepreneurship centric group that would compete in competitions worldwide. Here, professionalism, public speaking, and thinking creatively on one’s feet was foremost. From Freshman to Senior year, DECA really helped me in coming out of my shell and feel comfortable presenting to big groups of people without issue. I was an officer for two years, in the positions of Treasurer and Commissioner of Special Projects. In both of these roles, I was somebody who my fellow officers knew they could rely on to get projects finished on time or just someone to lean on in hard times. I always had my work done and made sure I was available to our underclassmen if they had questions. There were a number of committees I was a part of as well, including social planning panels for four consecutive years and the Civic Action Team. This group outlined all of the volunteer work participated in by the organization, ensuring that everything from fundraisers to street cleanups ran smoothly.<br><br>

        Beyond DECA, I was a part of the Mock Trial team, which furthered my comfort with public speaking and built on my ability to work in a team. The only way to be successful in competition was to fully and utterly lean on teammates, bringing together all of our individual strengths. Being on the Comedy Sportz team also facilitated vital teamwork skills, as improv requires the same. Successful shows with lots of laughter necessitates reading other members to build eachother up and create cohesive stories on the fly. Making up acts on the spot also greatly improved my creativity and capacity to think outside of the box. Whilst in these numerous clubs, I was also enrolled in many AP classes. These included European History, U.S. History, Physics 1, Chemistry, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Biology, Spanish, Language, and Literature, all of which I excelled in. These all require lots of work outside of the classroom to do well in, showing that I have good time management to be able to juggle these demanding courses, while also acting as an officer that required hours of time each week in addition to all of my other extracurriculars.
